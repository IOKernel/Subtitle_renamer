# Subtitle Renamer

A short python script I made to help me rename external subtitle files in my media server. 

## Usage

Straightforward, download and place the renamer.py to your show's directory.
### Make sure that the number of video files = the number of subtitle files in the folder
Edit the code with any text editor and add the file extensions you have, by default it only looks for MKV, MP4 and .SRT
```python
videoExtensions = ['.mkv', '.mp4']
subtitleExtensions = ['.srt']
```
Run the script (double click the file)
